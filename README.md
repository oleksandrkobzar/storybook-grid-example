# Storybook grid example

This app is a grid example using React, Storybook and SCSS. Main of my goal is representative my skills in building grid
for different devices and using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for building UI components in isolation.

I have
done [grid example](https://dev7778.dp9gsdsmko0pk.amplifyapp.com/?path=/story/grid-with-cards--default)
with cards according to "Grid" and "Cards" specifications. Additionally, I have
introduced [card story](https://dev7778.dp9gsdsmko0pk.amplifyapp.com/?path=/story/card--default),
[simple grid](https://dev7778.dp9gsdsmko0pk.amplifyapp.com/?path=/story/simple-grid--default) with ten cards where they are flexibly to
screen width of different devices according to specification and [grid with different sizes of card](https://dev7778.dp9gsdsmko0pk.amplifyapp.com/?path=/story/grid-with-different-sizes-of-card--default). Also, All images are responsive to help to get the
best performance and design control on different screens of devices and Retina screens.
